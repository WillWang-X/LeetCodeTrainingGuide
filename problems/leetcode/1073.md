# 1073. Adding Two Negabinary Numbers

Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together.

Each number is given in array format:  as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit.  For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] represents the number (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3.  A number arr in array format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either arr == [0] or arr[0] == 1.

Return the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1]
Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: arr1 represents 11, arr2 represents 5, the output represents 16.
``` 

Note:

* 1 <= arr1.length <= 1000
* 1 <= arr2.length <= 1000
* arr1 and arr2 have no leading zeros
* arr1[i] is 0 or 1
* arr2[i] is 0 or 1

``` python
class Solution:
    def addNegabinary(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = 0
        m, n = len(arr1), len(arr2)
        
        for i, is_1 in enumerate(arr1):
            if is_1: ans += (-2)**(m-i-1)
        for i, is_1 in enumerate(arr2):
            if is_1: ans += (-2)**(n-i-1)
                
        res = self.baseNeg2(ans)
        
        return [int(i) for i in res]
    
    def baseNeg2(self, N: int) -> str:
        if N == 0:
            return "0"
        res = ""
        while N != 0:
            res = str(N & 1) + res 
            N = -(N >> 1)
        return res

``` python
def addNegabinary(self, A, B):
    res = []
    carry = 0
    while A or B or carry:
        carry += (A or [0]).pop() + (B or [0]).pop()
        res.append(carry & 1)
        carry = -(carry >> 1)
    while len(res) > 1 and res[-1] == 0:
        res.pop()
    return res[::-1]
```

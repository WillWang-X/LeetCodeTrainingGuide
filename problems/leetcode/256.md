# 256. Paint House


There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:

* All costs are positive integers.

```
Example:

Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
``` 

## Idea 

- DP

```
cost = [[red,blue,green],[],[]...[]]
house: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    
red      min(red+blue,red+green)
blue     min(blue+red, blue+green)
green    min(green+red, green+blue)    
```

## Code 

``` python
class Solution(object):
    def minCost(self, costs):
        """
        :type costs: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not costs: return 0
        dp = costs[0]
        for i in xrange(1, len(costs)):
            currRed, currBlue, currGreen = costs[i][0], costs[i][1], costs[i][2]
            prevRed, prevBlue, prevGreen = dp
            dp = [
                min(currRed+prevBlue, currRed+prevGreen), # cost if current house is painted red
                min(currBlue+prevRed, currBlue+prevGreen), # cost if current house is painted blue
                min(currGreen+prevRed, currGreen + prevBlue) # cost if current house is painted green
            ]

        return min(dp)
```

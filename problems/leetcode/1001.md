# 1001. Grid Illumination

On a `N x N` grid of cells, each cell `(x, y)` with `0 <= x < N` and `0 <= y < N` has a lamp.

Initially, some number of lamps are on.  `lamps[i]` tells us the location of the i-th lamp that is on.  Each lamp that is on illuminates every square on its x-axis, y-axis, and both diagonals (similar to a Queen in chess).

For the i-th query `queries[i] = (x, y)`, the answer to the query is 1 if the cell (x, y) is illuminated, else 0.

After each query (x, y) [in the order given by queries], we turn off any lamps that are at cell (x, y) or are adjacent 8-directionally (ie., share a corner or edge with cell (x, y).)

Return an array of answers.  Each value `answer[i]` should be equal to the answer of the i-th query `queries[i]`.


## Idea 

1. Solution1: store the lamps that are on and remove each lamps after each query 
2. Solution2: store each row, cloumn, both diagonals. (heng, shu, bie, na)

# 1017. Convert to Base -2


Given a number N, return a string consisting of "0"s and "1"s that represents its value in base -2 (negative two).

The returned string must have no leading zeroes, unless the string is "0".

 

Example 1:

```
Input: 2
Output: "110"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 = 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 3
Output: "111"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 + (-2) ^ 0 = 3
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 4
Output: "100"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 = 4
``` 

Note:

* 0 <= N <= 10^9


## Ideas

- remainder 

``` python
# decimal to binary
10 = 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 
```

- difference between **Modulo Operation** and **Complementation**
	- truncation: The quotient is rounded towards **zero**
	- floored division: the quotient is always rounded downwards
	- from [Modulo operation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Modulo_operation)
- `%` in Python and Java
	- python: `5 % -2` 是 -1，即 5 = -2 * -3 + -1 
	- java: `5 % -2` 是 1，即 5 = -2 * -2 + 1

## Code 

``` python 
class Solution:
    def baseNeg2(self, N: int) -> str:
        if N == 0:
            return "0"
        res = ""
        while N != 0:
            res = str(N & 1) + res 
            N = -(N >> 1)
        return res 
```

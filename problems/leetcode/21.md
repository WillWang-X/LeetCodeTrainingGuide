# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists


Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example:

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

## Ideas

## Code 

### version 0.1 iterative 

``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = cur = ListNode(0)
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val > l2.val:
                cur.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next 
            else:
                cur.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next 
            cur = cur.next 
            
        cur.next = l1 or l2 
        return dummy.next
```

## version 0.2 recursive

inspired by [StefanPochmann](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/discuss/9771/Simple-5-lines-Python)

- If both lists are non-empty, I first make sure a starts smaller, use its head as result, and merge the remainders behind it. Otherwise, i.e., if one or both are empty, I just return what's there.

    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if l1 and l2:
            if l1.val > l2.val:
                l1, l2 = l2, l1
            l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
        return l1 or l2

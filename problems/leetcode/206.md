# [206](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/). Reverse Linked List

## Ideas 

* While you are traversing the list, change the current node's next pointer to point to its previous element. 
* Since a node does not have reference to its **previous** node, you must store its previous element **beforehand**. 
* You also need another pointer to store the next node **before changing the reference**. 
* Do not forget to return the new head reference at the end!

``` python
 pre | cur -> cur.next 
 x  <- pre  | cur
```

## Code 

### v0.2 iterative 

``` python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        pre, cur = None, head
        while cur:
            cur.next, pre, cur = pre, cur, cur.next 
        return pre
```

### v0.2 recursive 

```  
			head -> (a-b-c) # new_head
			         !a # head.next 
			head <- !a
   None <- head

```

``` python 
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Base case 
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head 
        
        new_head = self.reverseList(head.next)
        next_node = head.next 
        next_node.next = head
        head.next = None
        return new_head 
```

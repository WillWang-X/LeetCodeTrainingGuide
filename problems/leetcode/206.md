# 206. Reverse Linked List

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either **iteratively** or **recursively**. 

Could you implement both?

## Idea 

* While you are traversing the list, change the current node's next pointer to point to its previous element. 
* Since a node does not have reference to its previous node, you must store its previous element **beforehand**. 
* You also need another pointer to store the next node **before changing the reference**. 
* Do not forget to return the new head reference at the end!


## Code 

### version 0.1 iterative 

``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        pre = None 
        cur = head
        while cur:
            tmp = cur.next 
            cur.next = pre
            pre = cur
            cur = tmp
        return pre
```

### version 0.2  recursive 

```  
			head -> (a-b-c) # new_head
			         !a # head.next 
			head <- !a
   None <- head

```

``` python 
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Base case 
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head 
        
        new_head = self.reverseList(head.next)
        next_node = head.next 
        next_node.next = head
        head.next = None
        return new_head 
```

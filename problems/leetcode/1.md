# 1. Two Sum


Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## idea 

- cache what you have met 

## Code 

### version 0.1

``` python
# Time:  O(n)
# Space: O(n)

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        cache = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num in cache:
                return [cache[num], i]
            cache[target - num] = i
        return []
```

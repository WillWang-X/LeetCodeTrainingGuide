# 260. Single Number III


Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```


Note:

* The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
* Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

``` python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # XOR: to find the XOR of two nums
        two = 0 
        for num in nums:
            two ^= num
        
        # 10101000 -> 1000: to find the last one as the flag 
        i = 0
        while two & 1 == 0:
            two = two >> 1
            i += 1
        last_one = 1 << i
        
        # divide nums into two camps
        is_one, no_one = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            if num & last_one:
                is_one ^= num
            else:
                no_one ^= num
        return [is_one, no_one]

# 496. Next Greater Element I


You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
```    
    
Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Note:
All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.
```

## Idea 

* The brute force is just to find element in the nums2, and find its next time.
* which takes O(m*n) 
* casue the complete nums array(of size n) needs to be scanned for all the m elements of `findNums` in the worst case.


If we want to do in one pass, we itreate over the nums array from the left to right.
every time I encounter a new element, we need to look back and find the element that less than the current element, (last: the current nums), where stack involves. 
Cause we want to maintain an descending order in our stack. 
For example, [6,3,2,5], when we encounter [5], our stack is [6,3,2]
We just pop them out of stack when it is less than 5. 
To make it clear, when encounter a new when iterating,

If we have stack and element <stack[top], we add it into our stack, cause no element's next greater element is our current number.(elements in our stack is in an descending order)
while we have stack and the current element > stack[pop], we keep pop out of our stack until the current element < stack[top], cause nums[i] cannot act as the next greater element for stack[top].

We got ans {3:5, 2:5} {6:-1, 5:-1} cause when for loop ends we didn't find next greater for 5,6. In order to get our ans in O(1) for nums1, we need a dictionary in the form of (key = element, val = next_greater_element) with default val of -1. 

To wrap it up, we need 2 data strucutre: 
dictionary: let us to get answer in O(1)
stack: to push when element is less than stack[1] and to pop when element is larger than stack[-1].

Time: O(m+n). The entire nums array(of size n) is scanned only once. The stack's nn elements are popped only once.  The findNums array is also scanned only once.
Space: O(m+n). stack and map of size n is used. res array of size m is used, where n refers to the length of the nums array and m refers to the length of the findNums array.

### v0.1

``` python
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = collections.defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        stack = []
        for x in nums2:
            while stack and stack[-1] < x:
                last = stack.pop()
                ans[last] = x
            stack.append(x)
        return [ans[x] for x in nums1]

# 1035. Uncrossed Lines

We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j] as long as A[i] == B[j], and the line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3
```

Example 3:

```
Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
Output: 2
``` 

Note:

* 1 <= A.length <= 500
* 1 <= B.length <= 500
* 1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000

## Code 


### v0.1  Space O(n^2)

``` python
class Solution:
    def maxUncrossedLines(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
        R, C = len(A), len(B)
        dp = [[0]*(C+1) for _ in range(R+1)]
        for i in range(1, R+1):
            for j in range(1, C+1):
                if A[i-1] == B[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

### v0.2 Space O(n)

``` python
class Solution:
    def maxUncrossedLines(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
        R, C = len(A), len(B)
        dp = [0]*(C+1) 
        for i in range(R):
            for j in range(C)[::-1]:
                if A[i] == B[j]: dp[j+1] = dp[j] + 1
            for j in range(C):
                dp[j+1] = max(dp[j+1], dp[j])
        return dp[-1]

```

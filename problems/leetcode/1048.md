# 1048. Longest String Chain


Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters.

Let's say word1 is a predecessor of word2 if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in word1 to make it equal to word2.  For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac".

A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with k >= 1, where word_1 is a predecessor of word_2, word_2 is a predecessor of word_3, and so on.

Return the longest possible length of a word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:

```
Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: one of the longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
```

Note:

* 1 <= words.length <= 1000
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
* words[i] only consists of English lowercase letters.

### v0.1 bottom up 

``` python
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        dic = [{} for _ in range(17)]
        for c in words:
            dic[len(c)][c] = 1
        longest = 1
        for i in range(2, len(dic)):
            chars = dic[i]
            last = dic[i-1]
            for char in chars:
                for i in range(len(char)):
                    new = char[:i] + char[i+1:]
                    if new in last:
                        chars[char] = max(chars[char], last[new] + 1)
                        longest = max(longest, chars[char])
        return longest 
```

### v0.2 top down 

``` python
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        word_set = set(words)
        word_length = dict()
        result = 1
        for word in words:
            result = max(result, self.helper(word, word_length, word_set))
        return result
    
    def helper(self, word, word_length, word_set):
        if word in word_length:
            return word_length[word]
        length = 1
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if (word[:i] + word[i+1:]) in word_set:
                length = max(length, self.helper((word[:i] + word[i+1:]), word_length, word_set) + 1)
        word_length[word] = length
        return length
```

## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals


Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:
You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.


Example 1:

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

## Ideas

``` python
[ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]
-> sort()
[ [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [3,4] ]
012345678
-----------------------
 -  # [1,2]
 -- # [1,2] drop [1,3] cause 3 > 2
  -- # [1,2] [2,3]
    -- # [1,2] [2,3] [3,4]
        ------
         -
         -------

## Code 

### version: get the right interval

``` python
# Time: O(nlogn)
# Space: O(n)

# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> int:
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key = lambda x: x.start)
        res = []
        res.append([intervals[0].start, intervals[0].end])
        for interval in intervals[1:]:
            start, end = interval.start, interval.end
            if start >= res[-1][-1]:
                res.append([start, end])
            else:
                if end < res[-1][-1]:
                    res[-1] = [start, end]
        return len(intervals) - len(res)
```

### version: count the wrong interval

``` python 
# Time: O(nlogn)
# Space: O(1)

# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[Interval]) -> int:
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x.start)
        pre = 0
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i].start < intervals[pre].end:
                if intervals[i].end < intervals[pre].end:
                    pre = i
                cnt += 1
            else:
                pre = i
        return cnt
        
```

# 71. Simplify Path


Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.

In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix

Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

Example 4:

```
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

Example 5:

```
Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
Output: "/c"
```

Example 6:

```
Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
Output: "/a/b/c"
```

## Ideas 

- use stack cause I need to pop the last one when we meet ".."

## Code 

### version 0.1 run

``` python
# Time: O(n) n = len(path)
# Space: O(n) 

class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        p = path.split("/")
        stack = []
        for i, d in enumerate(p):
            if d and d != ".":
                if d == "..":
                    if stack: stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(d)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

## version 0.2 readable 

``` python 
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        places = [p for p in path.split("/") if p not in [".",""]]
        stack = []
        for _, p in enumerate(places):
            if p == "..":
                if stack: stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(p)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

## version 0.3 readable + faster 

``` python 
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for token in path.split("/"):
            if token in ["","."]:
                pass 
            elif token == "..":
                if stack: stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(token)
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```

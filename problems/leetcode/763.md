# 763. Partition Labels


A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

Example 1:

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

Note:

* S will have length in range [1, 500].
* S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.

## Ideas

- s1: valid substring -> sliding window
- s2: reduction

### v0.1 run

``` python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        counter = collections.Counter(S)
        temp = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        head = 0
        res = []
        for tail, char in enumerate(S):
            temp[char] += 1
            count = 0
            for key, val in temp.items():
                if counter[key] == val:
                    count += 1
            if count == len(temp):
                res.append(tail-head+1)
                head = tail+1
                temp = collections.defaultdict(int)
        return res 
```

### v0.2 readable 

- reduction: keep track of the last index(**one** variable) instead of **two** variables

``` python
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        last = {c : i for i, c in enumerate(S)}
        dest, head = 0, 0
        res = []
        for tail, c in enumerate(S):
            dest = max(dest, last[c])
            if dest == tail:
                res.append(tail - head + 1)
                head = tail + 1
        return res
```

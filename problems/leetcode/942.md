# 942. DI String Match

Given a string S that only contains "I" (increase) or "D" (decrease), let N = S.length.

Return any permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N] such that for all i = 0, ..., N-1:

If S[i] == "I", then A[i] < A[i+1]
If S[i] == "D", then A[i] > A[i+1]
 

Example 1:

```
Input: "IDID"
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "III"
Output: [0,1,2,3]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "DDI"
Output: [3,2,0,1]
``` 

Note:

* 1 <= S.length <= 10000
* S only contains characters "I" or "D".

## Ideas 


- greedy(= safest)
	* Think of available numbers to put as an array of [0, 1, 2, ..., len(S)]
	* When you see "I", your **safest** option is to put lowest(leftmost) number for the next move, so it will always increase
	* When you see "D", your safest option is to put highest(rightmost) number for the next move, so it will always decrease
	* Don't forget to put latest number when l == r

## Code 

### v0.1 

```python
class Solution:
    def diStringMatch(self, S: str) -> List[int]:
        i, j = 0, len(S)
        res = []
        for sign in S:
            if sign == "I":
                res.append(i)
                i += 1
            else:
                res.append(j)
                j -= 1
        res.append(i)
        return res 
        
```

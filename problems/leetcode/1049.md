# 1049. Last Stone Weight II


We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.
```

## Ideas

- math -> abstract: subset sum
- all possible two group

``` python 
[a, b, c, d, e]

a - b, c - d, e

(a + c + d) - (b + d)
```

## Code 

### v0.1 knapsack

``` python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {0}
        sumA = sum(stones)
        for a in stones:
            dp |= {a + i for i in dp}
        return min(abs(sumA - i - i) for i in dp)
            

# Time: O(NS)  where N = len(stones)
# Space: O(S), where S = sum(A).

```

### v0.2 

We use dp to record the achievable diff of one group.
If `x` in the set dp, it means the difference `x` is achievable currently.

``` python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {0}
        for x in stones:
            temp = set()
            for item in dp:
                temp.add(item - x)
                temp.add(item + x)
            dp = temp
        return min(dp, key=abs)
 
 class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp, sumA = {0}, sum(stones)
        for a in stones:
            dp = {a + x for x in dp} | {a - x for x in dp}
        return min(abs(x) for x in dp)   

# Time: O(NS)  where N = len(stones)
# Space: O(S), where S = sum(A).    
```

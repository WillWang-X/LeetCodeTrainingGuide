# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array


Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Idea

The whole ideas is to find **the sorted part** and use the binary search. 



## Code 

### version 0.1 binary search 

``` python
# Time: O(NlogN) where N = len(nums)
# Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            if nums[mid] >= nums[left]:
                if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1
            else:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
        return -1
```

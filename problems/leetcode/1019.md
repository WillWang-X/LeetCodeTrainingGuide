# 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List


We are given a linked list with head as the first node.  Let's number the nodes in the list: node_1, node_2, node_3, ... etc.

Each node may have a next larger value: for node_i, next_larger(node_i) is the node_j.val such that j > i, node_j.val > node_i.val, and j is the smallest possible choice.  If such a j does not exist, the next larger value is 0.

Return an array of integers answer, where answer[i] = next_larger(node_{i+1}).

Note that in the example inputs (not outputs) below, arrays such as [2,1,5] represent the serialization of a linked list with a head node value of 2, second node value of 1, and third node value of 5.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]
```

```
Example 2:

Input: [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]
```

```
Example 3:

Input: [1,7,5,1,9,2,5,1]
Output: [7,9,9,9,0,5,0,0]
``` 

Note:

* 1 <= node.val <= 10^9 for each node in the linked list.
* The given list has length in the range [0, 10000]. 

## Ideas 

- stack: maintain a order by push and pop 

dive deep:

- stack vs heap

## Code 

### version 0.1

``` python
# Time: O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n)
# Space: O(n) + O(n) + O(n)

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head: ListNode) -> List[int]:
        vals = []
        while head:
            vals.append(head.val)
            head = head.next 
        
        res = [0 for _ in range(len(vals))]
        stack = []
        for i, num in enumerate(vals):
            while stack and stack[-1][1] < num:
                index, _ = stack.pop()
                res[index] = num
            stack.append((i, num))
        return res 
                
```

### version 0.2 store one val

store the increasing index, who's value is decreasing

``` python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head: ListNode) -> List[int]:
        V = []
        while head:
            V.append(head.val)
            head = head.next 
        
        res = [0 for _ in range(len(V))]
        stack = []
        for i, num in enumerate(V):
            while stack and V[stack[-1]] < num:
                index = stack.pop()
                res[index] = num
            stack.append(i)
        return res 
```

### version 0.3 just iterate listnode

``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head: ListNode) -> List[int]:        
        res, stack = [], []
        while head:
            while stack and stack[-1][1] < head.val:
                res[stack.pop()[0]] = head.val
            stack.append([len(res), head.val])
            res.append(0)
            head = head.next
        return res
```

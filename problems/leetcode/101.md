# 101. Symmetric Tree


Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:


```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```   
   
Note:

- Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

## Ideas 

Start with definition.

Two trees are a mirror reflection of each other if:

* Their two roots have the same value.
* The right subtree of each tree is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the other tree.

Two solution:

1. recursive
2. iterative

## Code 

### version 0.1 recursive  
 
``` python 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not root:
            return True 
        return self.is_mirror(root.left, root.right)
    
    def is_mirror(self, t1, t2):
        if not t1 and not t2:
            return True 
        if not t1 or not t2:
            return False 
        if t1.val != t2.val:
            return False 
        return self.is_mirror(t1.left, t2.right) and \
               self.is_mirror(t1.right, t2.left)
        
```

### version 0.2 iterative

inspired by [LC](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/solution/)

Instead of recursion, we can also use iteration with the aid of a queue. Each two consecutive nodes in the queue should be equal, and their subtrees a mirror of each other.

```  python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(root)
        q.append(root)
        while q:
            t1 = q.popleft()
            t2 = q.popleft()
            if not t1 and not t2: continue 
            if not t1 or not t2:  return False 
            if t1.val != t2.val:  return False 
            
            q.append(t1.left)
            q.append(t2.right)
            q.append(t1.right)
            q.append(t2.left)
        return True 
        
```

# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree


Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

```
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
```

Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: 

* Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

- preorder and reverse

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.

            if not node:
                vals.append("#")

        return ",".join(vals)
        
    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.

        def recover():
            val = next(vals)
            if val == '#':
                return None 
            else:
                node = TreeNode(int(val))
                node.left = recover()
                node.right = recover()
                return node 
        vals = iter(data.split(","))

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root))

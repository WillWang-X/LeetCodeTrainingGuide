# 1074

Given a matrix, and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.

A submatrix x1, y1, x2, y2 is the set of all cells matrix[x][y] with x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.

Two submatrices (x1, y1, x2, y2) and (x1', y1', x2', y2') are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if x1 != x1'.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]], target = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the 2x2 submatrix.
```

Note:

* 1 <= matrix.length <= 300
* 1 <= matrix[0].length <= 300
* -1000 <= matrix[i] <= 1000
* -10^8 <= target <= 10^8

## Idea

- reduction: 
- like [85](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/) -> [84](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

        # dp[i][j] stores the sum of A[0][j], A[1][j], ..., A[i][j].
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])

        for j in range(n):
            for i in range(m):
                if i == 0: dp[i][j] = matrix[0][j]
                else: dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + matrix[i][j]
        rtn = 0
        for r1 in range(m):
            for r2 in range(r1, m):
                index = {0: 1}
                curr = 0
                for c in range(n):
                    curr += dp[r2][c]
                    if r1: curr -= dp[r1 - 1][c]
                    if curr - target in index:
                        rtn += index[curr - target]
                    if curr not in index: index[curr] = 1
                    else: index[curr] += 1
        return rtn

# 973. K Closest Points to Origin


We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

 

Example 1:

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

Note:

* 1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
* -10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
* -10000 < points[i][1] < 10000


## Ideas 

1. minheap: heapify + pop K 
- maxheap: maintain a heap with k elements 
- sort 


## Code 

### Version 0.1 minheap   O(n + klogn)

``` python 
# Time: O(n + klogn)
# Space: O(n)
# 440 ms	16.5 MB

import heapq
class Solution(object):
    def kClosest(self, points, K):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        heap = []
        for x, y in points:
            dis = x * x + y * y
            heap.append((dis, x, y))
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        res = []
        for _ in range(K):
            dis, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            res.append([x, y])
        return res 
```

### Version 0.2 maxheap  O(nlogk)

``` python 
# Time: O(nlogk)
# Space: O(k)

class Solution(object):
    def kClosest(self, points, K):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        h = []
        for p in points:
            if len(h) < K:
                heapq.heappush(h, (self.distance(p), p) )
            elif len(h) == K:
                heapq.heappushpop(h, (self.distance(p), p) )
        return [x[1] for x in h]
        
    def distance(self, point):
        return - (point[0] * point[0] ) - (point[1]* point[1]) 
        
```

### Version 0.3 sort  O(nlogn)

- lambda: sort 

``` python 

class Solution(object):
    def kClosest(self, points, K):
        """
        :type points: List[List[int]]
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        points.sort(key = lambda x:x[0]**2+x[1]**2)
        return points[:K]
```

### version 0.4 heap O(n + klogn)

``` python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        return heapq.nsmallest(K, points, key = lambda x: x[0]*x[0] + x[1]*x[1])
```

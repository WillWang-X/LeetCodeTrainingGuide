# 743. Network Delay Time


There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.

Note:
N will be in the range [1, 100].
K will be in the range [1, N].
The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 <= u, v <= N and 1 <= w <= 100.

## Ideas 

- Djikstra 遍历所有节点，返回记录的值。

### Case 

pure BFS failed.

```
[[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]
4
2
```

## Code

### Version 1.0 

``` python
"""
Time Complexity: O(N^2 + E) where E is the length of times in the basic implementation, and O(ElogE) in the heap implementation, as potentially every edge gets added to the heap.

Space Complexity: O(N + E), the size of the graph (O(E)), plus the size of the other objects used (O(N)).

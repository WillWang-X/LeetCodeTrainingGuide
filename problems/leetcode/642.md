# 642. Design Search Autocomplete System


Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:

* The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
* The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
* If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
* When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.


Your job is to implement the following functions:

The constructor function:

`AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):` This is the constructor. The input is historical data. `Sentences` is a string array consists of previously typed sentences.`Times` is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.

Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:

`List<String> input(char c):` The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), blank space (`' '`) or a special character (`'#'`). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.


Example:
Operation: AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2]) 
The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times: 
"i love you" : 5 times 
"island" : 3 times 
"ironman" : 2 times 
"i love leetcode" : 2 times 
Now, the user begins another search: 

Operation: input('i') 
Output: ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"] 
Explanation: 
There are four sentences that have prefix "i". Among them, "ironman" and "i love leetcode" have same hot degree. Since ' ' has ASCII code 32 and 'r' has ASCII code 114, "i love leetcode" should be in front of "ironman". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so "ironman" will be ignored. 

Operation: input(' ') 
Output: ["i love you","i love leetcode"] 
Explanation: 
There are only two sentences that have prefix "i ". 

Operation: input('a') 
Output: [] 
Explanation: 
There are no sentences that have prefix "i a". 

Operation: input('#') 
Output: [] 
Explanation: 
The user finished the input, the sentence "i a" should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search. 

Note:

* The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.
* The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.
* Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character input.
* Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.


## Ideas

* Design a good data structure: Modfied Trie 

### Cases

1. abc#: remove #
2. (abc, abc, abcc): if the top is duplicate

```
["AutocompleteSystem","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input","input"]
[[["abc","abbc","a"],[3,3,3]],["b"],["c"],["#"],["b"],["c"],["#"],["a"],["b"],["c"],["#"],["a"],["b"],["c"],["#"]]
```

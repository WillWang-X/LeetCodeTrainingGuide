# Algorithms By field of study

- [ ] Cover all frequently-used algorithms by field and build somthing like [Minimal](https://github.com/keon/algorithms)
- ‼️ This documentation will be updated in the main README.

## What

source: [wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Algorithm#/By_field_of_study)

Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are search algorithms, sorting algorithms, merge algorithms, numerical algorithms, graph algorithms, string algorithms, computational geometric algorithms, combinatorial algorithms, medical algorithms, machine learning, cryptography, data compression algorithms and parsing techniques.

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

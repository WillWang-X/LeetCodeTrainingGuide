# 20. Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

```
Input: "()"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "(]"
Output: false
```

Example 4:

```
Input: "([)]"
Output: false
```

Example 5:

```
Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

## Ideas 

It is the same as the question that just have one kind of bracket. We use a hashmap to store the relationship between open and close brackets. Now, hashmap is an abstraction of brackets relationship.

- Push the present character into stack if it's an opening symbol else pop a character from stack and check if it matches with the present character ( if it matches don't do anything else immediately return `false` )
- Note - At any point of time if stack is empty and present character is a closing bracket return false immediately
- Termination - if stack is empty return `true` else return `false`

## Code 

### version 0.1

Start with one kind of brackets. Then add a `hashmap` to represent the abstraction of different brackets relationship.

``` python
# Time: O(n)
# Space: O(n)

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        brackets = {"(":")","{":"}","[":"]"}
        stack = []
        for i, b in enumerate(s):
            if b in brackets:
                stack.append(b)
            else:
                if not stack:
                    return False 
                if brackets[stack.pop()] != b:
                    return False 
        return len(stack) == 0
```

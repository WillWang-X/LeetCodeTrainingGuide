# 127. Word Ladder


Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.

Note:

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

Example 1:

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

where N is the length of words and K is the maximum 
length of any given word. For each word in words, 
in order to find neighbors we may construct O(K) 
new words, each in O(K) time.

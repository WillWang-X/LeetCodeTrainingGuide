# 1022. Smallest Integer Divisible by K


Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
``` 

Note:

* 1 <= K <= 10^5

## Ideas

> (NUM1 * A + B) % num = (NUM2 * A + B) % num 

``` bash
1. int("1"*p)          for p in range(100)  
2. p = p * 10 + 1      for p in range(100)  ✅ Better

1         % 17 = 1
1*10 + 1  % 17 = 11
11*10 + 1 % 17 = 9   -> 111 * 10 + 1 =  9 * 10 + 1

Next one 
✅   9 * 10 + 1 % 17 = 6  -> will get into some loop and we only need to check K times cause there are only `K - 1` remainders
vs 111 * 10 + 1 % 17 = 6 
			...
			...
			...
     --------------- = 9  -> return false 
    
```

## Code 

``` python 
# Time: O(K-1) 
# Space: O(K)

class Solution(object):
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K):
        """
        :type K: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        K_str = str(K)
        if K_str[-1] not in ("1", "3", "7", "9"):
            return -1 

        value = 0
        length = 0
        remainder = set()
        while True:
            value = ( value* 10 + 1 ) % K 
            length += 1 
            if value == 0:
                return length
            if value in remainder:
                return -1 
            remainder.add(value)
        return -1
```

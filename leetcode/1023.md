# 1023. Camelcase Matching


A query word matches a given pattern if we can insert lowercase letters to the pattern word so that it equals the query. (We may insert each character at any position, and may insert 0 characters.)

Given a list of queries, and a pattern, return an answer list of booleans, where answer[i] is true if and only if queries[i] matches the pattern.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FB"
Output: [true,false,true,true,false]
Explanation: 
"FooBar" can be generated like this "F" + "oo" + "B" + "ar".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "F" + "oot" + "B" + "all".
"FrameBuffer" can be generated like this "F" + "rame" + "B" + "uffer".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBa"
Output: [true,false,true,false,false]
Explanation: 
"FooBar" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r".
"FootBall" can be generated like this "Fo" + "ot" + "Ba" + "ll".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: queries = ["FooBar","FooBarTest","FootBall","FrameBuffer","ForceFeedBack"], pattern = "FoBaT"
Output: [false,true,false,false,false]
Explanation: 
"FooBarTest" can be generated like this "Fo" + "o" + "Ba" + "r" + "T" + "est".
```

Note:

* 1 <= queries.length <= 100
* 1 <= queries[i].length <= 100
* 1 <= pattern.length <= 100
* All strings consists only of lower and upper case English letters.

### version 0.1 make it run

``` python 
class Solution:
    def camelMatch(self, queries: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[bool]:

        def check(A, B):
            if len(A) < len(B):
                return False 
            p = 0 
            for i, char in enumerate(A):
                # print(char, B[p])
                if char.isupper():
                    if char != B[p]:
                        return False 
                    p += 1
                else: 
                    if char == B[p]:
                        p += 1
                if p == len(B):
                    for j in range(i+1, len(A)):
                        if A[j].isupper():
                            return False 
                    return True
            return p >= len(B) 
            
        res = [False for _ in range(len(queries))]
        for i, query in enumerate(queries):
            if check(query, pattern):
                res[i] = True 
        return res 
```

### version 0.2 a clear definition about `match` process

make it general = high level abstraction 

* match
* not match 
	* lowercase ➕
	* uppercase ❌

The match process uses i for query pointer and j for pattern pointer, each iteration;

* If current char query[i] matches pattern[j], increase pattern pointer;
* if does not match and query[i] is **lowercase**, keep going;
* if does not match and query[i] is captalized, we should return false.

If this pattern matches, j should equal length of pattern at the end.

### version 0.3 Trick 

inspired by [lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/camelcase-matching/discuss/270029/Python-Short-and-Shorter)

``` python
class Solution:
    def camelMatch(self, queries: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[bool]:
        
        def u(word):
            return [char for char in word if char.isupper()]
        
        def match(pattern, word):
            it = iter(word)
            return all(char in it for char in pattern)
        
        return [u(q) == u(pattern) and match(pattern, q)  for q in queries]
```

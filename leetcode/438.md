# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given a string s and a non-empty string p, find all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

## Ideas

- sliding window 
	- `do`
	- `while` condition
	- `if` meets requirement  

## Code 

### version 0.1 

``` python
class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        
        seats = collections.Counter(p)
        head = 0
        
        res = []
        for tail, c in enumerate(s):
            seats[c] -= 1
            while head <= tail and seats[c] < 0:
                seats[s[head]] += 1
                head += 1
            if tail - head + 1 == len(p):
                res.append(head)
        return res 
                
        
```

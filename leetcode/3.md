# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters


Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Idea

- `longest`: **maintain** a window and **record** along the way
- `without`: **check** if it is a valid window 

## Code 

### Version 0.1

``` python
# 80 ms	12.5 MB
# Time: O(n) where n = len(s)
# Space: O(256), in the worse casse, we could hold 256 characters 

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: 'str') -> 'int':
        if not s:
            return 0 
        
        char_in_window = set()
        l, longest = 0, 1
        for r, char in enumerate(s):
            if char not in char_in_window:
                char_in_window.add(char)
            else:
                while s[l] != char:
                    char_in_window.remove(s[l])
                    l += 1
                l += 1
            longest = max(r-l+1, longest)
        return longest 
```

#### testcase 

```
"pwwkew"
```

Before

``` python 
                while s[l] != char:
                    l += 1
                    char_in_window.remove(s[l])          
```

After 

``` python 
                while s[l] != char:
                    char_in_window.remove(s[l])
                    l += 1
```

### Version 0.2

- Use `list` instead of `set` when you know all X->Y relationship in advance so that you don't have to take care of space allocation problem.

``` python
# 84 ms	12.7 MB
# Time: O(n) where n = len(s)
# Space: O(256), in the worse casse, we could hold all chars in s

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: 'str') -> 'int':
        longest = 0
        start = 0
        visited = [0 for _ in range(256)]
        
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if visited[ord(c)] == 1:
                while c != s[start]:
                    visited[ord(s[start])] = 0
                    start += 1
                start += 1
            else:
                visited[ord(c)] = 1
            
            longest = max(longest, i - start + 1)
            
        return longest 
```

# 1029. Two City Scheduling


There are `2N` people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `A` is `costs[i][0]`, and the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city B is `costs[i][1]`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `N` people arrive in each city.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
``` 

Note:

* 1 <= costs.length <= 100
* It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
* 1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000


## Ideas

* Sort the array with subtraction weight coefficient. 
* If someone's cost is like [40, 41], his weight coefficient is -1 so that he can go to either A or B. But if someone's cost is like [40, 40000], his weight coefficient is -39960 so that he would absolutely go to **A**. 
* After sorting the array, people from 0 to N-1 should go to A and people from N to 2N-1 should go to B. Then count the sum.



## Code

### version 0.1 run

- redefine the object that how to compare

``` python 
class tuplebydiff(tuple):
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self[0] - self[1] < other[0] - other[1]    
        
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        costs = [tuplebydiff((x, y)) for x, y in costs]
        costs.sort()
        half = len(costs) // 2
        return sum([x for x, _ in costs[:half]]) + sum([y for _, y in costs[half:]])
```

### version 0.2 simplify comparison function

``` python
class Solution:
    def twoCitySchedCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(costs) // 2
        costs.sort(key = lambda c: c[0] - c[1])
        return sum(a if i < N else b for i, (a, b) in enumerate(costs))
```

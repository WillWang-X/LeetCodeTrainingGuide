# 15. 3Sum

Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:

```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

```

## Idea

- reuse two_sum()

        nums.sort()
        ans = []

### version 0.5 avoid invoke another function

```
# Time: O(n^2)

                        head, tail = head+1, tail-1
                        while head < tail and nums[head] == nums[head-1]:
                            head += 1
                        while head < tail and nums[tail] == nums[tail+1]:
                            tail -= 1
            
        return res 
```

## Debug

### 0.1 

```
[0,0,0]
```

code 

``` python
        def two_sum(sub_nums, target):
            cache = set()
            res = []
            for i, num in enumerate(sub_nums):
                if num not in cache and (target-num) in cache:
                    res.append([target - num, num])
                cache.add(num) 
            return res 
        
```
why?

- Try to avoid the duplicate answer but forget the edge case `[0, 0, 0]`

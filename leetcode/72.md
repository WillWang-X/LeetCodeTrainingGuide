# 72. Edit Distance


Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

* Insert a character
* Delete a character
* Replace a character

Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

Example 2:
```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Ideas

- Define: let `dp(i, j)` = the minimum number of edits required **for the problem with strings** `words1[i:]` and `words2[j:]`.
	- dp(i, j) = dp(i+1, j+1) if word1[i] = word2[j]
	- else dp(i, j) = 1 + min(dp(i+1, j), dp(i, j+1), dp(i+1, j+1))

## Code

### version 0.1  top down 

``` python
# Time: O(M*N) where M = len(word1), N = len(word2)
# Space: O(M*N)
# 136 ms	16.2 MB

class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        memo = {}
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == len(word1) or j == len(word2):
                memo[(i,j)] = max(len(word1) - i, len(word2) - j)
            if (i, j) not in memo:
                if word1[i] == word2[j]:
                    memo[(i, j)] = dp(i+1, j+1)
                else:
                    memo[(i, j)] = 1 + min(dp(i+1, j), dp(i, j+1), dp(i+1, j+1))
            return memo[(i,j)]
        return dp(0, 0)
```
	
### version 0.2 bottom up 

- slower cause it caches something we don't need 

``` python
# 188 ms	19 MB	
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        M, N = len(word1), len(word2)
        dp = [[i for i in range(M+1)] for _ in range(N+1)]
        for i in range(len(dp)):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):
            for j in range(1, len(dp[0])):
                if word2[i-1] == word1[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

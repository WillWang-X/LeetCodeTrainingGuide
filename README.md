> When you understand something, then you can find the math to express that understanding. The math doesn't provide the **understanding**. The purpose of computing is **insight**, not numbers. The only real valuable thing is **intuition**.

## Why 

> My journey to be an algorithm master

There are so many books, websites, videos and repositories about algorithm. Why do you create a new one? Because they are not what I want. So what is your need?

* The **intuition** behind each typical algorithms
* The **basics** and **big picture** about problems type and related data structure & algorithms
* The **ways of thinking** that can be transferred to other areas
* The prospect of solving the **problem** by myself, which is the most important

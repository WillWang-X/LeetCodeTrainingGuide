# Aogrithms with Illustration 


> When you understand something, then you can find the math to express that understanding. The math doesn't provide the **understanding**. The purpose of computing is **insight**, not numbers. The only real valuable thing is **intuition**.  
> 
> --- *Leslie Lamport & Richard Hamming & Albert Einstein*


## Features

- Provide the **intution** behind every typical algorithm problem 
- Cover most **core** algorithms and design techniques
- **Systemize** data structure and algorithms design techniques

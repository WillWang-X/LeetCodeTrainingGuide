- [Dynamic Programming ‚Äì 7 Steps to Solve any DP Interview Problem](http://blog.refdash.com/dynamic-programming-tutorial-example/)

Consider using DP whenever you have to **make choices** to arrive at the solution, specifically, when the solution relates to subproblems.

In addition to optimization problems, DP is also **applicable** to **counting and decision problems**‚Äîany problem where you can express a solution recursively in terms of the same computation on smaller instances.

Although conceptually DP involves recursion, often for efficiency the cache is **built "bottom-up"**, i.e., iteratively. 

To save space, **cache space** may be **recycled** once it is known that a set of entries will not be looked up again. 

Sometimes, **recursion may out-perform a bottom-up DP** solution, e.g., when the solution is found early or subproblems can be **pruned** through bounding.

## Explain 

> Define your recurrence relation and base cases. Besides, try to improve your space complexity if possible.

* [LC91 Decode Variations](https://www.pramp.com/challenge/r1Kw0vwG6OhK9AEGAy6L) (in terms of, only reference)
	* **Let** dp(i) **be the answer for the string** S[i:]. We can calculate dp(i) **in terms of** dp(i+1) and dp(i+2).  
	* If S[i] == 0 ... 2 ... > 2...  Putting this all together ...
	* Of course, **since at each step** we only **reference** dp[i+1] and dp[i+2], we could **store these as variables** `first` and `second`. This means we do not need to store the entire array.
* [LC72 Edit Distance](https://repl.it/@WillWang42/edit-distance) (two steps, either...or..., in general, recursively)
	* Our solution will be built in two steps: first we‚Äôll **find the editing distance**, and then **use it to construct the answer**. 
	* First, let `dp(i, j)` = the minimum number of edits required **for the problem with strings** `source[i:]` and `target[j:]`. 
	* We will perform what is known as ‚Äútop-down dynamic programming.‚Äù What this means is: Since `dp(i, j)` may depend only on the values of `source[i]`, `target[j]`, `dp(i+1, j)`, `dp(i, j+1)`, and `dp(i+1, j+1)`, we can write a function `dp(i, j)` that returns the desired answer **recursively** **in terms of** these values. 
	* **In general**, when `source[i] == target[j]`, then `dp(i, j) = dp(i+1, j+1)`, because we simply write `source[i]`. When `source[i] != target[j]`, then we **either** edited `source[i]` (subtraction) and **have the problem of transforming** `source[i+1:]` to `target[j:]` left over (which has answer `dp(i+1, j)`), **or** we edited `target[j]` (addition) and have the problem of transforming `source[i:]` to `target[j+1:]` left over (which has answer `dp(i, j+1)`).
	* **Constructing the Answer**
	* Now we need to build our answer. We should **iterate through the source and target**, and in each step decide whether we need to delete or add another letter.
	* To figure this out, we need to **leverage this information** available in `dp(i, j)`. When we have a decision to make between subtracting `source[i]` or adding `target[j]`, we will use our knowledge of the minimum edit distances `dp(i+1, j)` and `dp(i, j+1)` to make our decision.

> In computational geometry, a sweep line algorithm or plane sweep algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that uses a conceptual sweep line or sweep surface to solve various problems in **Euclidean** space. [[wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sweep_line_algorithm)]

## üìù1. Basics

The idea behind algorithms of this type is to imagine that **a line** (often a vertical line) is swept or moved across the plane, stopping at some points. Geometric operations are restricted to geometric objects that either intersect or are in the immediate vicinity of the sweep line whenever it stops, and the complete solution is available once the line has passed over all objects.

## üí¨5. Explanation 

* [Euclidean space](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Euclidean_space): Euclidean space was introduced by ancient Greeks as an abstraction of our physical space, but in modern mathematics there are Euclidean spaces of any nonnegative integer dimension, including the three-dimensional space and the Euclidean plane.
* [computational geometry](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computational_geometry): a branch of computer science devoted to the study of **algorithms** which can be stated in terms of **geometry**.

> In computer science, iterative compression is an algorithmic technique for the design of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, in which one element (such as a vertex of a graph) is added to the problem in each step, and a small solution for the problem prior to the addition is used to help find a small solution to the problem after the step.

## What 

### Base

In computer science, iterative compression is an algorithmic technique for the design of **fixed-parameter tractable algorithms**, in which one element (such as a vertex of a graph) is added to the problem in each step, and a small solution for the problem prior to the addition is used to help find a **small solution** to the problem after the step.

### History

The technique was invented by Reed, Smith and Vetta[1] to show that the problem of odd cycle transversal was solvable in time O(3k kmn), for a graph with n vertices, m edges, and odd cycle transversal number k. Odd cycle transversal is the problem of finding the smallest set of vertices of a graph that include at least one vertex from every odd cycle; its parameterized complexity was a longstanding open question.This technique later proved very useful in showing fixed-parameter tractability results. It is now considered to be one of the fundamental techniques in the area of parameterized algorithmics.

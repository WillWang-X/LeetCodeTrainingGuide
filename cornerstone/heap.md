## Notes
Use a heap when all you care about is the **largest** or **smallest** elements, and you do not need to support fast lookup, delete, or search operations for arbitrary elements. [Problem 11.1]

A heap is a good choice when you need to compute the k **largest** or k **smallest** elements in a collection. For the former, use a min-heap, for the latter, use a max-heap. [Problem 11.4]

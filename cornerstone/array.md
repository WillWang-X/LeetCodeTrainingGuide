## 基础知识

Array problems often have simple brute-force solutions that use 0(n) space, but subtler solutions that **use the array itself** to **reduce space** complexity to 0(1).


Front -> Back:

* Filling an array **from the front** is slow, so see if it's possible to **write values from the back**. 
* Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its right), consider **overwriting** it. When dealing with integers encoded by an array consider **processing the digits from the back** of the array. 
* Alternately, reverse the array so the **least-significant digit** is the first entry.

Be comfortable with writing code that operates on **subarrays**. 

It's incredibly easy to make **off-by-1** errors when operating on arrays. 

Don't worry about preserving the **integrity** of the array (sortedness, keeping equal entries together, etc.) until it is time to return. 

An array can serve as a good data structure when you know the distribution of the elements in advance. For example, a Boolean array of length W is a good choice for representing **a subset of** (0,1,..., W- 1]. (When using a Boolean array to represent a subset of (1,2,3,...,«}, allocate an array of size n+1 to simplify indexing.) 

When operating on 2D arrays, **use parallel logic** for rows and for columns. 

Sometimes it's easier to **simulate the specification**, than to analytically solve for the result. For example, rather than writing a formula for the i-th entry in the spiral order for an n X n matrix, just compute the output from the beginning. 

### Key word 

*  reduce space 
*  overwriting 
*  front to back (write or process)
*  used as hashmap
*  simulate the specification

## 最佳实践

- [libraries]((https://i.imgur.com/VNGOnCx.png))
- preprocess: 
	- sort the array first -> binary search 
	- hashing (val -> index) 
	- a prefix/suffix sum/product -> to get subarray sum
- search 
	- sliding window / two pointers
	- use **index** instead of slicing when possible (O(1) vs O(n))
	- out of bounds
	- array used as a hashmap
- access / change
	- processing the element from the back
	- simulate

### corner case 

- Empty sequence.
- Sequence with 1 or 2 elements.
- Sequence with repeated elements.

### out of bounds

``` python
def is_in(x, y, matrix):
	return 0 <= x < len(matrix) and 0 <= y < len(matrix[0])
```

### prefix sum (subarry sum)

``` python
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    nums[i] += A[i-1]
```

### caculate all pairs

``` python
def max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    maxprofit = 0
    if len(prices) <= 1:
        return 0
    minprice = prices[0]
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        maxprofit = max(prices[i] - minprice, maxprofit)
        minprice = min(prices[i], minprice)
    return maxprofit 
```

More general case: subarray and caculation involved. 

```  python
# all possible two subarray sum for i < j  (L < M)
# keep track of max(L) before a fixed `M`
          L(M)
         --
      -- 
   --
--
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
		    ----
			  M(L)
```

``` python
left = 0
res = 0 
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
	left = max(left, cacluate_left(i))
	res = max(left + nums[i], res)
```

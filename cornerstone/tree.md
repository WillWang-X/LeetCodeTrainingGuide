# Tree 




## What is Tree?

> 1. A tree data structure can be defined **recursively** (locally) as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
> 2. A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges **without having any cycle**. The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy.

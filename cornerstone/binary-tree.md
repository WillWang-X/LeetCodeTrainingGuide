# Binary tree


## Points

 **Recursive algorithms** are well-suited to problems on trees. Remember to include space implicitly allocated on the **function call stack** when doing space complexity analysis. 
 
Some tree problems have simple brute-force solutions that use 0(n) space solution, but subtler solutions that uses the **existing tree nodes** to reduce space complexity to 0( 1). 

Consider **left- and right-skewed trees** when doing complexity analysis. Note that 0(h) complexity, where h is the tree height, translates into 0(log n) complexity for balanced trees, but 0(n) complexity for skewed trees. [Problem 10.12]

If each node has a **parent field**, use it to make your code simpler, and to reduce time and space complexity. [Problem 10.10]

It's easy to make the **mistake** of treating a node that has a single child as a leaf.
